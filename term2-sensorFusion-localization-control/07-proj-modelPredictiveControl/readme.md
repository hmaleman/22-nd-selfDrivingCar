# Project: Model Predictive Control

## 1. Goal
The goal of this project was to develop a Model Predictive Controller for the steering angle and throtle based on target trajectory input and perfect vehicle localization / error to the trajectory data. In addition, a controller output to actuator delay (latency) of 100ms was also simulated.

## 2. Applied methodology
### 2.1. The simulator environment provided several inputs for the controller

## 3. Results

## 4. Build instructions

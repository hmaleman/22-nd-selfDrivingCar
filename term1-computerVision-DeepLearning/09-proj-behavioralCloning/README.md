# Project: Behavioral Cloning

This project was forked from Udacity's repository [CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3).

That repository contains additional information on how to use the generated model to drive the simulator autonomously and how to record it.

This project has two outputs:
- The report and discussions which are summarized at: [02-proj-behavioralCloning-generator.ipynb](https://github.com/hmaleman/course-udacity-selfDrivingCarND/blob/master/term1-computerVision-DeepLearning/09-proj-behavioralCloning/02-proj-behavioralCloning-generator.ipynb)
- A recorded lap from the final model running at Track1: [video.mp4](https://github.com/hmaleman/course-udacity-selfDrivingCarND/blob/master/term1-computerVision-DeepLearning/09-proj-behavioralCloning/video.mp4)
